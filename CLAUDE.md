# Claude Code Assistant Configuration for Agent Container

## Project Overview

This is the **Agent Container** project - a Docker-based development
environment for working with AI coding agents (Claude Code and Gemini CLI)
using Git worktrees. The project provides containerized isolation for
development work with AI assistants.

## Key Technologies & Tools

### Container Environment

- **Base**: Debian 13 slim
- **Runtime**: Node.js, Python 3, Docker CLI
- **AI Agents**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI (installed via npm)
- **Development Tools**: Git, curl, gosu, ripgrep, jq, yq
- **Python Tools**: pip, pipenv, poetry, pre-commit, uv
- **Languages**: Go (v1.25.0), Python 3
- **Linting**: hadolint for Dockerfile validation

### Code Quality Tools

**All quality tools work EXCLUSIVELY through pre-commit hooks.**
Direct tool commands are not available in this environment.

Pre-commit hooks are extensively configured for:

- File validation (JSON, YAML, TOML, XML)
- Code formatting (Ruff for Python)
- Security (detect-secrets)
- Shell scripts (shellcheck via pre-commit)
- Markdown (markdownlint via pre-commit)
- Docker (hadolint via pre-commit)
- Python linting and formatting

## Development Workflow

### Task Management

**CRITICAL**: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks. This is
essential for:

- Breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Tracking progress throughout the session
- Ensuring no steps are missed
- Providing visibility to users about current progress

### Pre-commit Quality Checks (MANDATORY)

**ALL changes must pass pre-commit checks before completion.** This project
has strict quality standards:

```bash
# ALWAYS run this after making ANY changes
pre-commit run --files <filename>

# For multiple files or all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Install hooks (required once per environment)
pre-commit install
```

**Common pre-commit fixes needed:**

- Files must end with exactly one newline
- No trailing whitespace
- Markdown must follow strict linting rules (see below)
- Shell scripts must pass shellcheck
- No secrets or credentials in files

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the container image
docker build -t ghcr.io/johnstrunk/agent-container .

# Test with current directory
./start-work

# Test with a git branch (creates worktree)
./start-work feature-branch-name
```

### Specific Tool Validation via Pre-commit

**IMPORTANT**: All linting tools work ONLY through pre-commit hooks.
Direct tool commands are not available in this environment.

```bash
# Lint Dockerfile specifically (through pre-commit)
pre-commit run hadolint --files Dockerfile

# Validate shell scripts specifically (through pre-commit)
pre-commit run shellcheck --files *.sh

# Check markdown formatting specifically (through pre-commit)
pre-commit run markdownlint --files *.md
```

## File Modification Guidelines

### Shell Scripts

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Include `set -e -o pipefail` for safety
- Follow shellcheck recommendations
- Use double quotes for variables: `"$VARIABLE"`
- Use local variables in functions: `local var_name="$1"`

### Dockerfile

- Follow hadolint recommendations
- Don't worry about providing image digests. Renovate-bot handles this.
- Use build cache mounts where appropriate
- Minimize layers and use multi-stage builds when beneficial
- Pin version numbers for reproducibility

### Documentation

**Markdown files have STRICT formatting requirements:**

- **Line length**: Maximum 80 characters per line
- **Code blocks**: Must specify language (e.g., `bash`, `text`, `yaml`)
- **Headings**: Must have blank lines before AND after
- **Lists**: Must have blank lines before AND after
- **Code blocks**: Must have blank lines before AND after
- **File ending**: Must end with exactly one newline
- **No trailing whitespace** on any line

**Common markdown fixes:**

```bash
# Check markdown before committing (ONLY through pre-commit)
pre-commit run markdownlint --files <filename>.md
```

Note: Auto-fix is not available - markdownlint only validates. You must
manually fix all reported issues

## Environment Variables

### Claude Code Configuration

- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` - Model to use
  (default: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)
- `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` - Fast model for simple tasks
- `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` - Google Cloud project for Vertex AI
- `CLOUD_ML_REGION` - Cloud region for Vertex AI
- `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` - Use Vertex AI instead of direct API

### Gemini CLI Configuration

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - API key for Gemini

### Container Runtime

- `EUID` - User ID for container user (default: 1000)
- `EGID` - Group ID for container user (default: 1000)
- `PYTHON_TOOLS` - Comma-separated list of Python tools to install

## Container Architecture

### Entrypoint Flow

1. `entrypoint.sh` - Creates user/group, sets up permissions, configures
   Docker access
2. `entrypoint_user.sh` - Installs Python tools with uv, sets up pre-commit

### Volume Mounts

- `/worktree` - Main working directory
- `~/.claude` - Claude Code configuration
- `~/.gemini` - Gemini CLI configuration
- `~/.config/gcloud` - Google Cloud configuration
- `~/.cache/pre-commit` - Pre-commit cache
- `/var/run/docker.sock` - Docker socket access

### User Security

- Container runs as non-root user
- UID/GID mapping from host
- Docker group access when socket is available
- Proper permission handling for mounted volumes

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Tools

1. **Plan your actions**: Create tasks for each step
2. Update Dockerfile to install the tool
3. Update entrypoint scripts if user-level setup is needed
4. Update README.md with usage instructions
5. **MANDATORY**: Run `pre-commit run --all-files` and fix any issues
6. Test the build and functionality
7. **Mark tasks complete** as you finish each step

**Note**: All linting (hadolint, shellcheck, etc.) happens through pre-commit.
No direct tool commands are available.

### Modifying Pre-commit Hooks

1. **Plan your actions**: Create tasks for testing changes
2. Edit `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
3. Run `pre-commit install` to update hooks
4. **CRITICAL**: Test with `pre-commit run --all-files`
5. Fix any issues that arise (may require multiple iterations)
6. Verify all checks pass before considering complete

### Updating Dependencies

1. **Plan your actions**: Break down into specific updates
2. Update version numbers in Dockerfile
3. Update pre-commit hook versions in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
4. **MANDATORY**: Run pre-commit checks after each change
5. Rebuild and test the container
6. Verify all quality checks pass

### Creating or Modifying Documentation

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW** for any `.md` file changes:

1. **Plan your actions**: Include pre-commit verification as a task
2. Make your documentation changes
3. **IMMEDIATELY** run: `pre-commit run --files <filename>.md`
4. **Fix ALL issues** found (may require multiple rounds)
5. **Re-run** pre-commit until all checks pass
6. Only then consider the task complete

**Expected markdown issues and fixes:**

- Line too long → Break into multiple lines
- Missing language in code block → Add `bash`, `text`, etc.
- Missing blank lines → Add blank lines around headings/lists/code blocks
- Missing final newline → Will be auto-fixed by end-of-file-fixer

## Security Considerations

- Pin all external dependencies with specific versions
- Use minimal base images
- Run as non-root user
- Validate all inputs in shell scripts
- Use detect-secrets pre-commit hook to prevent credential leaks

## Testing Strategy

**Multi-layered validation approach:**

1. **Pre-commit validation** (MANDATORY for all changes)
   - Run `pre-commit run --files <changed-files>` after each change
   - Fix all issues before proceeding
   - Must pass 100% before task completion

2. **Component-specific testing**
   - Manual testing with `./start-work` script
   - Container build testing
   - Volume mount and permission testing
   - AI agent functionality testing within container

3. **Iterative quality checking**
   - Test early and often during development
   - Fix issues immediately when found
   - Re-run checks until all pass

## Maintenance Notes

- Container image is published to `ghcr.io/johnstrunk/agent-container`
- Renovate bot handles dependency updates
- Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality
- All shell scripts should pass shellcheck
- Dockerfile should pass hadolint validation
